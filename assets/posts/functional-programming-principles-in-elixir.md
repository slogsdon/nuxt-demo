From the meetup description:

> Join us as we discuss core functional programming principles, focusing on Elixir's usage/implementation of them, and comparing these principles against an object-oriented programming language. We'll be covering first-class functions, pure vs. impure functions, iteration, type systems (briefly), and the many uses of lists along the way.
