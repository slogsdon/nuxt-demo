Presented this iteration of this Heartland eCommerce presentation at the Internet Merchants Association's sessions during ASD Market Week, July 31, 2016.

A payment form's capabilities, technology, and user experience all play a part in making the process of checking out as easy and streamlined as possible for customers. Walk through my team's findings as we build a better payment experience for our merchants and their customers.
